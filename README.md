# The Game Room client wanted to modify the game Draw It or Lose It into a web-based application from its existing Android application. The new game would have further use on devices other than Android devices. 

# I think that while developing this document I succeeded at giving good recommendations in Project Three. 

# While developing the code I found that clearly laid out tasks from the design document were helpful to check that I had completed all the necessary work. 

# The part of the design document that I would redo is the first part that summarized the design constraints because I feel that it is a part that is lacking compared to other parts of the document. To improve that section I would add more detail and think a lot about the subject. 

# I tried to put myself in the user's shoes when interpreting their needs and then endeavored to fulfill my needs like I was the user. 

# I took what I was given and made the most of it when creating the design documentation but in the future, I would ask more questions about the project because I work well when all my questions have been answered or at least asked in the case that a decision is left to me.

# Artemis Financial is an international banking company that needed to implement a way to securly communicate using an encryption algorithm cipher.

# I think I was able to find the vulnerabilities that were critical to understand when giving a recommendation. It is important to code securly because the company will lose money if there is information leackage. The software security adds peace of mind value and accountablility.

# I worked through the vulnerabllity assessment step by step so that I did not miss anything. This also made it take longer which was challenging.

# I went to a publilc forum to find how to begin and went from there. I will need to remember to account for the need for security when planning my code in the future.

# I tested the code to make sure it was finctional and secure. I continued to test after refactoring the code.

# I think the dependency check report is a tool I will be using in the future. 
# I think I will show them the refactored code that adds layers of security.


# CS 255

# DriverPass wants a website that customers can log into. the website: make lesson appointments and take practice driving tests.

# I think I made clear and easy to understand diagrams for the UML assignments.

# I would make the gnatt chart which i never made.

# I looked at the interview document and tried to understand their needs from that and also what I would want if i was a customer.
# I took a overview approach because I need to understand the big picture so that I can find the little things that shouldnt be missed. in the future I will be looking at alternate methods to achieve the same result but in a more efficient method.
