# CS230 

  

# The Game Room client wanted to modify the game Draw It or Lose It into a web-based application from its existing Android application. The new game would have further use on devices other than Android devices. 

# I think that while developing this document I succeeded at giving good recommendations in Project Three. 

# While developing the code I found that clearly laid out tasks from the design document were helpful to check that I had completed all the necessary work. 

# The part of the design document that I would redo is the first part that summarized the design constraints because I feel that it is a part that is lacking compared to other parts of the document. To improve that section I would add more detail and think a lot about the subject. 

# I tried to put myself in the user's shoes when interpreting their needs and then endeavored to fulfill my needs like I was the user. 

# I took what I was given and made the most of it when creating the design documentation but in the future, I would ask more questions about the project because I work well when all my questions have been answered or at least asked in the case that a decision is left to me.
