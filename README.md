# CS230

# The Game Room client wanted to modify the game Draw It or Lose It into a web-based application from its exsisting Android application. The new game would have further use on other devices other than Android devices.
# I think that while developing this document I suceeded at giving good recommendations in Project Three.
# While developing the code I found that clearly laid out tasks from the design document were helpful to check that I had completed all the necessary work.
# The part of the design document that I would redo is the first part that summarized the design contraints because I feel that it is a part that is lacking compared to other parts of the document. To improve that section I would add more detail and think longer on the subject.
# I tried to put myself in the user's shoes when inteerpereting their needs and then endevored to fufill my needs like i was the user.
# I took what I was given and made the most of it when creating the design documnentation but in the future I would ask more questions about the project because I work well when all muy questions have been answered or at least asked in the case that a desision is left to me.
